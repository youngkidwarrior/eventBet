# Event Bet

Event Bet is a test repo I created to practice proper React and Node techniques for an Ethereum dApp. The idea is to provide users with a event scheduling system where they can vote on the time and date of the event. Users can also bet Ethereum on the time and date of the event. Currently Event Bet supports Metamask login and creating events.

## Installation

1. ```git clone  https://github.com/youngkidwarrior/eventBet.git```
2. Install packages with 
  ```npm install``` 
3. Start the nodemon server 
  ```npm run start:server``` 
4. Run the dApp 
  ```npm start``` 

**Note:
Evetn Bet requires an Ethereum testnet in order to run.

To run your own testnet,

1. Install ganache-cli 
  ```npm install -g ganache-cli```
2. Run the CLI with 
  ```ganache-cli```
